## Running the Code

### Datasets
Place the `datasets` folder inside the `hyperXGB` folder.

### Download the Data
Download the UCI datasets from [this link](https://github.com/lingping-fuzzy/UCI-data-correct-split) and create a folder named `data` under `hyperXGB` to store them.

## hyperbolic Data

The network embeddings can be downloaded from [this repository](https://github.com/hhcho/hyplinear). We copy the WordNet embeddings and labels for our experiments [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14Mmp_jGmLu5jkKpvv_vIR7K-e0Pdl8BV?usp=sharing) from code [link](https://github.com/LarsDoorenbos/HoroRF/tree/main)

> **Note**: The upload process is not yet complete. Additional data will be available soon.

# Compared Algorithms in `hororf/hsvm`

This folder (`hororf/hsvm`) contains the implementation code of various algorithms used for comparison in our experiments.

We sincerely thank the original authors for publicly sharing their code, which made our comparative analysis possible.
